C++ Programming Internship - CodeAlpha (15th Dec 2024 - 15ht Jan 2025)
Welcome to the repository for my C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha, spanning from 15th December 2024 to 15th January 2025.

-- Repository Overview --
This repository contains all the projects, assignments, and practice exercises completed during my internship. The main focus is on gaining hands-on experience with C++, strengthening my problem-solving skills, and applying theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

-- Contents --
Core C++ Programs: Implementations of fundamental C++ concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and more.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Practical applications of OOP principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction in C++.

Algorithms & Problem Solving: C++ implementations of common algorithms and data structures to improve problem-solving efficiency.

Real-World Projects: End-to-end projects that showcase my ability to develop complete applications using C++.

Learning Notes: Documentation of important learnings, challenges faced, and insights gained throughout the internship.

-- Purpose --
This repository is a reflection of my journey through the internship, highlighting the progress Iâ€™ve made and the skills Iâ€™ve gained. Itâ€™s intended to serve as both a personal resource and a public showcase of my work.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements.
